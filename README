NAME
    App::perlzonji - A more knowledgeable perldoc

VERSION
    version 1.111470

SYNOPSIS
        # perlzonji UNIVERSAL::isa
        # (runs `perldoc perlobj`)

DESCRIPTION
    "perlzonji" is like "perldoc" except it knows about more things. Try
    these:

        perlzonji xor
        perlzonji foreach
        perlzonji isa
        perlzonji AUTOLOAD
        perlzonji TIEARRAY
        perlzonji INPUT_RECORD_SEPARATOR
        perlzonji '$^F'
        perlzonji PERL5OPT
        perlzonji :mmap
        perlzonji __WARN__
        perlzonji __PACKAGE__
        perlzonji head4

    For efficiency, "alias pod=perlzonji".

    The word "zonji" means "knowledge of" in Japanese. Another example is
    the question "gozonji desu ka", meaning "Do you know?" - "go" is a
    prefix added for politeness.

FUNCTIONS
  run
    The main function, which is called by the "perlzonji" program.

  try_module
    Takes as argument the name of a module, tries to load that module and
    executes the formatter, giving that module as an argument. If loading
    the module fails, this subroutine does nothing.

  execute
    Executes the given command using "exec()". In debug mode, it also prints
    the command before executing it.

  find_matches
    Takes a word and returns the matches for that word. It's in a separate
    function to separate logic from presentation so other programs can use
    this module as well.

OPTIONS
    Options can be shortened according to "Case and abbreviations" in
    Getopt::Long.

    "--perldoc-command", "-c"
        Specifies the POD formatter/pager to delegate to. Default is .
        "perldoc" "annopod" from AnnoCPAN::Perldoc is a better . alternative
        .

    "--debug"
        Prints the whole command before executing it.

    "--dry-run", "-n"
        Just print the command that would be executed; don't actually
        execute it.

    "--help", "-h", "-?"
        Prints a brief help message and exits.

    "--man", "-m"
        Prints the manual page and exits.
